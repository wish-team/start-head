## Introduction to Time Layer 2 RPC

Time Layer 2 is an advanced, scalable Layer 2 solution developed by Start Head, designed to support high-throughput decentralized applications. It uses an Optimism rollup combined with Geth for efficiency, offering a fast and cost-effective way to interact with blockchain data and transactions.

With Time Layer 2 RPC, developers can connect their applications directly to the blockchain, making it easier to send transactions, query blockchain state, and interact with smart contracts in a highly optimized environment.
